Steam Quicklaunch
Make steam quick launch:
	Show games, allow multiple categories
	Allow launching by double clicking game
	Allow pressing global hot key (Win+G, or custom) to show a search box
		narrows list of games as you type
		press enter once game is selected to launch
			closes search area once launched
	Load style settings (back/foreground colors, font, etc.) from current user’s settings
	Load game list from current user’s games
	Load current user
		if no better way, compare timestamps on Steam\userdata\<userid>\config\localconfig.vdf and assume user with the latest stamp is the current user
