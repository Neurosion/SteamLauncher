Hook up hot keys to toggle visibility of the application.
Applications are not loading the correct set, some are not installed, others are not showing up at all.
Refactor applications to have a SteamApplication that takes a SteamProxy in the constructor rather than passing all apps to proxy
	This will allow having OriginApplication, DesuraApplication, CustomApplication, etc.

Notes:
	Look out for "Module not found error" when trying to register hooks on systems that are not Windows 7 64 bit.

Tests:
	Test ViewModel launch activation under MainWindow
	Test MainWindowViewModel with hot key
	Error handlers
	NotifyIcon
	Application Model
	Settings view model
	Main view model

Future:
	Add Origin support
	Add Desura support
	Add custom games support
